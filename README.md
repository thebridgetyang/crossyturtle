- A fun game in which the user has to move a turtle as far as possible, dodging all obstacles and collecting powerups and coins along the way.

- Inspired by the infamous mobile game "Crossy Road" and the adorable turtles that populate Caltech's Turtle Pond.

- Coded by Bridget Yang, Joseph Kim, Jay Siri, and Pranay Satya all in C for our final project in Caltech's CS 3: Software Design course.
